K-means Clustering Using Hadoop Map Reduce

1. Configured a single-node Hadoop cluster and implemented MapReduce K-means. 
2. Compared time complexity and achieved results with non-parallel K-means for given datasets. 
3. Also, compared non-parallel and parallel K-Means using externals namely Rand Index and Jaccard Coefficient.
